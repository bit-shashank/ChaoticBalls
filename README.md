# ChaoticBalls
A simple simulation depicting chaotic balls

## Theory

Simulation consists of two balls which were released from approximately the same position (difference of fewer than 0.0005 units). Even though the system was so simple and all collisions were perfectly elastic yet both balls couldn't stay together for too long and got apart following different trajectories, making the system chaotic.


## How to run

The Simulation was made in [Processsing](https://processing.org/). Download the code and open the project in processing.
